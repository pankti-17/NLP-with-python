# NLP-with-python
Repo that contains my work on NLP done during undergoing a course named NLP with python.
Link to the course is: https://www.udemy.com/course/nlp-natural-language-processing-with-python/learn/

It basically teaches on how to use SpaCy for doing various NLP tasks. 

P.S.: Many other notebooks yet to be uploaded as the course is in progress.
